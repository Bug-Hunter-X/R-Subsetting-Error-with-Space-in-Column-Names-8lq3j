# R Subsetting Bug with Space in Column Names
This repository demonstrates a common error in R when subsetting data frames with column names containing spaces. The bug arises from improper handling of column names with spaces during subsetting, leading to incorrect results or errors.

## Bug Description
The `bug.r` file contains code that attempts to subset a data frame using a character vector of column names. However, because some column names include spaces, the subsetting operation fails, resulting in an error or unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.r` file provides a corrected version of the code. It uses backticks to correctly handle column names with spaces, ensuring that the subsetting operation is performed as expected.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.r` and run the code in an R environment.
3. Observe the error or unexpected behavior.
4. Open `bugSolution.r` and run the corrected code. Observe the proper output.

## Key Learning Points
- When working with data frames in R, pay close attention to column names, especially when they include spaces or special characters.
- Use backticks to properly subset data frames with column names that have spaces or special characters. This ensures that the column names are interpreted correctly.
